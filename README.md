# Collection of experiments on programming and source code

This repo contains a bunch of N-of-1 experiments that I designed once. Some are older experiments that were originally written in Java and that I converted now to JavaScript in order to ease the execution of experiments. You can start
each experiment just by clicking on the links in the list below.

In case you are interested in N-of-1 experiments in programming and software science, you might be interested in the following paper (available via public access)

[Hanenberg, Mehlhorn, "Two N-of-1 self-trials on readability differences between anonymous inner classes (AICs) and lambda expressions (LEs) on Java code snippets", Empir. Softw. Eng. 27(2): 33 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-021-10077-3)

Each experiment generated a csv file at the end of the experiment. The present code does not do the analysis automatically (just load the csv into your preferred stats program and run an ANOVA).

In case you have questions or comments, just drop me an email.
