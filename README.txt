Finally (after months of pain), I decided to combine the repositories

  - Experiments
  - N-of-1-Experimentation

into one project. It will take some time, but hopefully, you can just run all code by

1. clone experiments
2. create a subdirecty N-of-1-Experimentation, taken from
   https://github.com/shanenbe/N-of-1-Experimentation

....should make life much less painful.
